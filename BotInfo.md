  <summary>Privacy Policy</summary>
<p>At The Watching Eye, accessible from @TheWatchingEyeBot on Telegram one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users.
This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by The Watching Eye.
     <br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for users who come into contact to our Telegram Bots with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in The Watching Eye or that Telegram shares with The Watching Eye related to them. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than these Telegram Bots.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lawful bases
<p> We do not ask for your prior consent in relation to the data that is saved as the following information is essential to be able to provide the services to the groups that use our Bot.

The lawful bases we rely on for processing your information are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We offer a public service for the protection of Telegram groups.
     <br>
Telegram does not offer any feature to automatically protect groups, which is why our bot acts in the public interest in this regard, offering a mostly free service for protecting groups from any unwelcome external and internal attacks.
     <br>
The manual group management functions provided directly by Telegram are incomplete or hard to be used: through our bot it is possible to greatly facilitate the action of administrators to protect their groups, compensating for the shortcomings of the platform itself.
</li>
        <li>We pursue the legitimate interest of groups and their group managers, who use our services also for 360-degree management of the same.</li>
      </ul>
<p>This doesn't affect your rights, which are explained in detail later in this document.</p>
